# Toyota Auto-Validation (Harman) Demo

**Summary:** Automated validation demo for embedded automotive systems, showcasing programmatic control of test equipment and data-driven testing scenarios using C# scripts.

**Problem:** Demonstrate automated validation and reporting for an embedded automotive system.

**Approach:** Create demo recordings and validation scripts (C# demo artifacts included in the project folder) showing system-level test scenarios and reporting. The software automatically and programmatically updates the properties of the function generator machine to match the input values from the code based on what is required for each given data set and frequency response scenario (such as `DAB Stereo: Speed, -30dB, 80mph`).

**Results:** Demo video and notes showcasing test methodology and results.

Skills demonstrated:

- Test/validation mindset, automation and reporting
- Communication of validation results to stakeholders

Why this is relevant to Shure:

- Highlights validation and verification experience which complements firmware development and release processes.
