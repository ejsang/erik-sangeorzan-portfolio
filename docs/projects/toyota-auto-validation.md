## Downloads & Video
- The demo video file `IMG_0092.mov` is large (≈161 MB) and exceeds GitHub's recommended single-file size limit. I can either:
  - compress/transcode it to <100 MB (requires `ffmpeg` on this machine — I can install or you can provide a compressed version), or
  - host it externally (YouTube unlisted / Vimeo / Google Drive) and embed it here (recommended to preserve quality and avoid large repo storage).

If you want me to compress it here, confirm and I will install `ffmpeg` and compress to a web-friendly MP4; otherwise provide a hosted link and I’ll embed it.
