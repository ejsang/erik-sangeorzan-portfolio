# Toyota Auto-Validation (HARMAN) Demo

**Summary:** Automated validation demo for embedded automotive systems, showcasing programmatic control of test equipment and data-driven testing scenarios using C# scripts.

**Problem:** Demonstrate automated validation and reporting for an embedded automotive system.

**Approach:**
- Developed C# validation scripts to automate system-level test scenarios.
- Implemented programmatic control of lab equipment (function generators) to simulate input signals.
- Automated parameter updates for variable test conditions (e.g., specific data sets, frequency response scenarios like `DAB Stereo: Speed, -30dB, 80mph`).

**Results:** Demo video and notes showcasing test methodology and results.

### Skills demonstrated

- **Test Automation:** Equipment control API implementation and test case parameterization.
- **Reporting:** Automated generation of validation results and reports.
- **Verification:** System-level validation mindset and stakeholder communication.

### Why this is relevant to Shure

- Highlights validation and verification experience (HARMAN), which complements firmware development and release processes.
