# Glasgow Index Analyzer (Python)

**Summary:** A signal-processing and analysis pipeline for physiological data (CPAP/EDFs) with test automation, plotting and integration with sleep data.

**Problem:** Analyze PAP device data to compute and study a bespoke "Glasgow Index" and related metrics across large datasets.

**Approach:** Build a Python pipeline to ingest device logs, integrate external sleep data, compute metrics, and automate plotting and correlation analysis; include unit tests for key components.

**Results:** Reusable analysis scripts, automated tests, and visualizations (heatmaps, trend plots).
