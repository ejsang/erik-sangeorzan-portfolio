## Shure-tailored cover letter (draft)

Dear Hiring Team,

I am a software engineer with strong embedded and audio experience seeking to contribute to Shure’s Product Development Division. Over the past four years I’ve delivered low-level firmware and audio processing solutions using C/C++ on STM32 and Teensy platforms, implemented real-time DSP pipelines (FFT / ICA), and built drivers and low-latency audio paths in constrained systems. I have experience with multithreaded and multicore processing, hardware synchronization (GPIO, I2S, UART), and automated testing and validation.

My recent projects include a real-time voice separation system (embedded audio capture + Raspberry Pi processing), a synthesizer implemented with assembly-level drivers for audio playback and storage, and STM32-based control firmware for embedded robotics. These projects demonstrate skills Shure calls for: embedded C/C++, audio DSP, hardware driver development, real-time system design, and rigorous testing.

I enjoy working cross-functionally to shape architecture and deliver high-quality firmware. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with the Senior Embedded Software Engineer role.

Sincerely,
Erik Sangeorzan

## Live drafts (recommended)

You can keep editing your resumes and cover letters as DOCX files and have the site link to them for download, or host them in Google Docs for live updates and embedding. Choose whichever workflow you prefer — here are the options and how I can help:

- Local DOCX (repo):
  - Files are available in the repository root:
    - `Erik Sangeorzan Resume 12-29 for Shure.docx`
    - `Shure Cover Letter 2025.docx`
  - Edit locally and push commits to update the files in the repo; I can add explicit download links or change the site to surface the latest versions after each push.

- Google Docs (recommended for real-time editing):
  - Option A (embed read-only view): Open your DOCX in Google Docs, then: File → Publish to web → Embed → copy the `src` URL or `iframe` snippet. Share that published URL with me and I will embed the document in the portfolio for live, read-only updates.
  - Option B (editable link): Share an editable Google Drive link and I will add a clearly visible "Edit in Google Docs" button on the site that opens the doc for editing (this is not embeddable as an editable iframe).

Notes & privacy
- Publishing a Google Doc to the web makes it publicly viewable via the published link (read-only); do not publish if you want to keep the content private. If you prefer privacy, keep the DOCX in the repo and only push new versions when ready.

### Published embeds (read-only)

Below are the published, read-only embeds you provided. These show the published content only (no version history or suggestions).

Notes & privacy (continued)
- The published embeds are read-only and do not expose version history; to stop public access, go to the document in Google Docs → File → Publish to web → Stop publishing.

Next steps
- If you’d like, I can add an "Edit in Google Docs" button that opens the editable doc in a new tab (requires sharing the editable link). Otherwise the embeds are live and will reflect edits you make and republish.

If you'd like, I can still convert the resume to a markdown page for the site so it’s browsable, but I won’t convert to PDF until you’re ready to lock the content.
